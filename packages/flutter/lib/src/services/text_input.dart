/// An low-level interface to the system's text input control.
///
/// To start interacting with the system's text input control, call [attach] to
/// establish a [TextInputConnection] between the system's text input control
/// and a [TextInputClient]. The majority of commands available for
/// interacting with the text input control reside in the returned
/// [TextInputConnection]. The communication between the system text input and
/// the [TextInputClient] is asynchronous.
///
/// The platform text input plugin (which represents the system's text input)
/// and the [TextInputClient] usually maintain their own text editing states
/// ([TextEditingValue]) separately. They must be kept in sync as long as the
/// [TextInputClient] is connected. The following methods can be used to send
/// [TextEditingValue] to update the other party, when either party's text
/// editing states change:
///
/// * The [TextInput.attach] method allows a [TextInputClient] to establish a
///   connection to the text input. An optional field in its `configuration`
///   parameter can be used to specify an initial value for the platform text
///   input plugin's [TextEditingValue].
///
/// * The [TextInputClient] sends its [TextEditingValue] to the platform text
///   input plugin using [TextInputConnection.setEditingState].
///
/// * The platform text input plugin sends its [TextEditingValue] to the
///   connected [TextInputClient] via a "TextInput.setEditingState" message.
///
/// * When autofill happens on a disconnected [TextInputClient], the platform
///   text input plugin sends the [TextEditingValue] to the connected
///   [TextInputClient]'s [AutofillScope], and the [AutofillScope] will further
///   relay the value to the correct [TextInputClient].
///
/// When synchronizing the [TextEditingValue]s, the communication may get stuck
/// in an infinite when both parties are trying to send their own update. To
/// mitigate the problem, only [TextInputClient]s are allowed to alter the
/// received [TextEditingValue]s while platform text input plugins are to accept
/// the received [TextEditingValue]s unmodified. More specifically:
///
/// * When a [TextInputClient] receives a new [TextEditingValue] from the
///   platform text input plugin, it's allowed to modify the value (for example,
///   apply [TextInputFormatter]s). If it decides to do so, it must send the
///   updated [TextEditingValue] back to the platform text input plugin to keep
///   the [TextEditingValue]s in sync.
///
/// * When the platform text input plugin receives a new value from the
///   connected [TextInputClient], it must accept the new value as-is, to avoid
///   sending back an updated value.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [TextField], a widget in which the user may enter text.
///  * [EditableText], a [TextInputClient] that connects to [TextInput] when it
///    wants to take user input from the keyboard.
